# Screen Sharing Project

This is a basic implementation of a screen sharing application using WebRTC and Socket.io.

## Setup

1. Install Node.js if you haven't already.
2. Navigate to the `server` directory and run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the server.
4. Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

## Usage

1. On one device or browser tab, go to the "Share Your Screen" page and click the "Start Sharing Screen" button.
2. Choose which screen or application window you want to share when prompted.
3. On another device or browser tab, go to the "View Shared Screen" page to view the shared screen.

Note: This is a basic implementation and may not work across different networks without a proper TURN server setup.
