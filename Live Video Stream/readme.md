# Live Stream Project

This is a basic implementation of a live streaming application using WebRTC and Socket.io.

## Setup

1. Install Node.js if you haven't already.
2. Navigate to the `server` directory and run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the server.
4. Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

## Usage

1. On one device or browser tab, go to the "Start Broadcasting" page and click the "Start Broadcasting" button.
2. On another device or browser tab, go to the "Watch Stream" page to view the broadcast.

Note: This is a basic implementation and may not work across different networks without a proper TURN server setup.
